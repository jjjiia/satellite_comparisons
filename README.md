# satellite_comparisons

These interactives experiment with combining satellite images with Census data.

When you sort by a criteria in the dropdown, if values of different tracts are equal, they are then sorted by the total population in that tract - 100% of a tract with population of 500 is placed lower in the order than a 100% tract with 3000 in total population
